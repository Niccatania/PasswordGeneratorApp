# PasswordGeneratorApp
This app will allow you to generate a password with certain parameters

# Description
The goal of this project was to explore javascript by creating an application that generates a password that randomizes the type of characters a user selects. I accomplished this by using prompts, confirms, if/else statements, and the math.random function.
